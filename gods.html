<pre><code>If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him
- Voltaire
</code></pre>
<h3 id="intro--explanation">Intro &amp; Explanation</h3>
<p>First off, I’ll front my baggage and say that I am, if pressed hard enough, a believer in a pretty strict material reading of the universe. We’re made of matter and as such, we’re constructed by and likely directed by material processes. This read on reality is, obviously, boring as shit.</p>
<p>Luckily for us, there is an aspect of human existence that is, strictly speaking, not material. People don’t actually have any access to my oh so precious material reality. What we do have is a user interface taylor made for us thanks to our dear friend evolution. This immaterial user interface is what we call consciousness.</p>
<p>After being alive for 20 years, I’ve decided that I don’t actually find questions about the True and Correct™️ nature of reality to be very interesting. Reality on its own is of no consequence without its relation to me or to others. <em>This</em> is where the magic lies.</p>
<p>If I am to seek understanding of anything, by all accounts that thing should be the very thing that allows for understanding at all (confusing sentence but you get it).</p>
<h3 id="part-i---whats-in-a-mind">Part I - What’s in a Mind?</h3>
<p>I primarily view the mind as being driven by emotion. More specifically, in each mind resides what I call an Emotional Landscape™️ (I think that’s an original term but it’s possible someone has already coined it). This emotional landscape can be described as a series of beliefs about oneself and about the world, about how one relates to the world. I think in psychology this is basically what they call your ego.</p>
<p>This emotional landscape contains beliefs about how you relate to yourself, others, and the world at large. Most but not all of these beliefs are held subconsciously at a level just below your conscious thoughts. These beliefs motivate us and set our expectations for the world and for ourselves.</p>
<p>When a person is confronted with a stimulus that confirms a belief held this way, it soothes their ego, makes them feel safe and at peace. When the world diagrees with our ego, this tends to provoke some kind of automatic response which is usually aggression or detachment. Generally, the ego does not like to be wrong and will attempt to contort reality to make itself right, or will reject/ignore the reality it is presented with.</p>
<p>When not confronted or otherwise left unaddressed, our egos are quite capable of running our lives in any direction they see fit.</p>
<h3 id="part-ii---making-things-true">Part II - Making Things True</h3>
<p>Subconscious beliefs can be understood as things that are ‘true’ for the individual that holds them. The fascinating thing about this is that those beliefs can change, usually by having certain emotional experiences OR by identifying and directly challenging the belief. Because these beliefs relate to the self, challenging them often comes in the form of an “I am” statement. For example, if someone is struggling to ask out a girl, the counter to that lack of confidence, likely brought on by an unconscious belief in their own inadequacy, is to reassert a contrary belief that one would <em>rather</em> be true, such as, “I am confident/powerful/worthy/him” (I prefer the last one).</p>
<p>If action stems from emotional belief and belief is about the nature of the self, being some way allows us to act in some way which lends credence to the initial belief. Goethe said it well.</p>
<pre><code>Before you can do something you must first be something.
</code></pre>
<p>In this way, our beliefs literally create our reality. If we believe ourselves inadequate we will in turn perform inadequacy. If we believe ourselves powerful we will seek and excercise power.</p>
<p>Some people call this the law of attraction, others call it manifestation, I don’t know what I’d call it but whatever it is I couldn’t be more convinced of its truth.</p>
<p>This idea is so true in fact, I would argue that it is deeply connected to everyone’s favorite big guy in the sky.</p>
<h3 id="part-iii---gods">Part III - God(s)</h3>
<p>What makes a god real? To a nonbeliever, a god is real if they make their existence known, presumably through some observable means. To a believer their god is real because they observe them through all means. To a nonbeliever who sees a flash of lightning and hears the echo of thunder, their mind goes to concepts of static electricity or considers the distance between them and the strike based on the delayed rumble. A believer sees the fury and wrath inherent to such a divine display power.</p>
<p>In the emotional landscape of the believer, the god is as real as anything else, but this goes deeper than simply observations of phenomena. When one acts in belief of a god, that god is given form, given real power through that believer. The truthful, mind independant existence of the God of Abraham is of no consequence to those killed in crusades whose last moments were spent engaged by those who manifest his will. Similarly, the mother who leaves an extra dollar in the collection tray after her daughters recovery following a blessing from her local priest is manifesting divinity.</p>
<p>Gods exist in the acts of those who believe in them. When enough people are sufficiently devoted to belief in a particular god, that god is made real through the social force created by the believers as a group.</p>
<p>Furthermore, any person who acts in accordance with any doctrine or creed can be said to be in service to the will of that creed as a god.</p>
<h3 id="part-iv---choosing-gods">Part IV - Choosing Gods</h3>
<p>Everyone makes countless choices every second of every day. These choices are in service to our emotions, our ideals. When we focus our time, energy, and resources towards particular ends, because they gain power through us, those ends <em><strong>become</strong></em> our gods. This, in my view, is not a choice. Everyone has gods. The greedy businessman who stays late instead of spending time with his family prays at the alter of wealth as god and rejects the god of family. The bodybuilder who sacrifices their emotional health and body for maximum muscles gains is in service to the god of muscles.</p>
<p>These negative examples paint this in a bad light, however, this is not negative. It is inevitable, necessary. By understanding gods in this way it allows us to clearly make a choice: who will you serve? We are all given the choice to serve any combination of gods that we want.</p>
<p>For me, the question then becomes simple, which gods can I truly devote myself in service of. In my life, I have served many gods over many years. I have found fulfillment in some and misery in others. Today I attempt to serve only one, myself. We have the capacity to fashion ourselves as a god and live in service to ourselves as such. I don’t see this as the only choice, just the one for me.</p>
<p>I leave any readers who made it this far with this final message: You have the power to choose which gods to make real. Whichever you choose <em><strong>will</strong></em> gain power over you.</p>
<p>Choose carefully.</p>
